# AMATH 383 Final Project 

## Project Description

This repository contains all of the MATLAB code and LaTeX that I wrote for my final project for the class AMATH 383 (Introduction to Continuous Mathematical Modeling) at the University of Washington. This project primarily focuses on modeling the COVID-19 outbreak based on data reported by the World Health Organization during the intial outbreak in China's Hubei province. I chose this as the main focus for my project because this was early on when COVID-19 began spreading throughout the world and we did not have much research or knowledge about it as we currently do. 

Please do not plagarize my work and just use it as a reference for your own personal research and work.

## Project Layout

# LaTeX

This folder contains the LaTeX I wrote for my final report.

# matlab_code

This folder contains all of the MATLAB code and functions I wrote to generate my plots. There are multiple folders for different models (SIR, SEIR, SIR + Vaccine, SEIR + Vaccine) and stability analysis. There are multiple files for testing different reproductive numbers (the number of individuals one infected person can be expected to spread the disease to) and different intial infected populations. 

# plots

This folder contains the plots I generated from my MATLAB code.
